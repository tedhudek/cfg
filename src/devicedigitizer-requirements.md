| Target Feature<br/> | Device.Digitizer.Base<br/>     |
| Applies to<br/>     | Windows 7 Client x86, x64<br/> |

 

Description

For devices that support pen or touch input, a pen or touch device must appear to Windows as a human interface device (HID) pen or touch device, respectively. If the device appears a mouse, pen and touch features will not be enabled, and the mouse input requirements will apply. Pen digitizer requirements are as follows:

Pen digitizers must appear to the operating system as HID pen digitizers and not as mouse or other proprietary devices.

Sample rate must be at least 100 Hertz.

Resolution must be at least 600 pixels per inch and at least five times the display resolution.

While hovering within 5 millimeters, the pen's position and the position that the device reports must be within 2 millimeters of each other. This accuracy requirement applies whether the input is stationary or in motion.

The physical contact with the device and the contact position that the device reports must be within 2 millimeters of each other. This accuracy requirement applies whether the input is stationary or in motion.

Touch digitizer requirements are as follows:

Touch digitizers must appear to the operating system as HID touch digitizers and not as mouse or other proprietary devices.

Sample rate must be at least 100 Hertz.

Resolution must be at least 200 pixels per inch and at least matching the display resolution.

In terms of jitter, if a contact is stationary, the reported position data must not change.

In terms of contact accuracy, tracing a line, circle, or other predetermined pattern should produce data that is within 0.5 millimeters of the expected data pattern. The pattern may be offset as a whole in accordance with the following contact-offset requirement.

The physical contact with the device and the contact position that the device reports must be within 2 millimeters of each other. This requirement applies whether the input is stationary or in motion.

Note that we encourage performing linearity calibration before running the pen and touch tests. For more information, see the section about linearity calibration in the OEM Preinstallation Kit (Windows OPK) documentation. For resistive touch digitizers, we recommend optimizing for the touch experience: 80 grams-force spacers provide a good experience.

Description

If the digitizer supports n simultaneous touch inputs (Where 'n' is the maximum number of supported touch inputs reported through HID), the first n inputs remain valid while additional inputs up to 5 must be ignored. If more than n+5 inputs are placed on the screen and accurate tracking of the original n inputs cannot be guaranteed, then it is strongly recommended to stop tracking all inputs including n+5.

| Target Feature<br/> | Device.Digitizer.Touch<br/>    |
| Applies to<br/>     | Windows 7 Client x86, x64<br/> |

 

Description

Input requirements apply to all touchable areas, including edges and corners, and will be tested over a regular distribution of points and patterns that cover the entire surface. For battery-operated devices, the requirements must be met whether the device is running on AC or battery power. The Windows Touch certification program is available for multi-touch digitizers that have a screen size of 30 inches or smaller. Multi-touch digitizers that are greater than 30 inches can obtain a signed driver through the unclassified category.

Multi-touch digitizers must appear to the operating system as human interface device (HID) digitizers, and not as mouse or other proprietary devices.

Sample rate must be at least 50 Hertz per finger.

Resolution must be at least 25 pixels per inch and at least matching the display resolution.

In terms of jitter, for all fingers, if a contact is stationary, the reported position data must not change.

No data must be reported for locations where contact is not made.

In terms of contact accuracy, the following requirements must be met on all corners of the screen and at least 95 percent of points and patterns tested.

For a single touch on a stationary contact point, the contact position reported must be within 2.5 millimeters of the target point. For a single touch that traces a line, circle, or other predetermined pattern, the contact data reported must be within 2.5 millimeters of the target pattern, with an offset from the pattern that varies no more than 1 millimeter for every 10 millimeters of travel, and without interruption to the pattern. For additional touches on a stationary contact point, the contact position reported must be within 5 millimeters of the target point. For additional touches that trace a line, circle, or other predetermined pattern, the contact data reported must be within 5 millimeters of the target pattern, with an offset from the pattern that varies no more than 2 millimeters for every 10 millimeters of travel, and without interruption to the pattern. Definitions are as follows:

Pixels per inch. Calculation of sqrt(x^2 + y^2)/diagonal screen size in inches, where x is the number of pixels on the horizontal axis and y is the number of pixels on the vertical axis.

Target point. The location targeted on the screen. For a target point that is smaller than the area of contact, the digitizer should determine which part of the contact area should be reported, such as the geometric center of the area or the point of greatest pressure. Microsoft tests will be conducted via the geometric center of the contact area of a typical finger (or rounded stylus) that is at least 12.5 millimeters in diameter. Calibration should occur before logo testing for certification.

Single touch. A touch made when no other contact is present on the screen.

Additional touches. One or more touches made when a contact is already present on the screen, or multiple touches placed simultaneously on the screen.

The Windows Touch certification program is a full test. Independent Hardware Vendors (IHVs) must submit hardware to the Windows Touch Test Lab for manual verification. For more information about the Windows Touch Test Lab, go to http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/input/WindowsTouch\_Test-Lab.mspx. Manufacturers should contact their account manager for copies of the OEM Preinstallation Kit (Windows OPK) guidelines. A white paper that provides guidance on HID pen and touch digitizer drivers can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/input/PEN\_touch.mspx.

The time stamp can be taken at the beginning or end of the frame, but the setting should remain consistent. There is no need to synchronize it to any definition of absolute time. Use rollover for the time stamp, so there is no need to reset to zero.   Timestamp should be 100 µs units/resolution and be provided to the OS in a 16-bit (2 byte) field in the HID reportAt any instance, allowable clock drift +/- 5% across standard operating temperatures (+25°C to + 85°C)

Description

The touch controller is required to implement three different power states:Active - The state where the touch controller is fully powered and functioning per device requirements. Idle - The state transitioned to from 'Active' when the touch controller has not received input for a specified period of time. Idle timeout is fixed at 5 seconds (by the OS) when connected via USB due to selective suspend requirements/implementation, and shall be fixed at 300 seconds by the touch controller when connected via I2C.Off - The state where the touch controller is powered down

Description

When in an active power state, the touch digitizer reporting rate must be maintained at a minimum of 100 Hertz for all touch inputs reported through HID, for both stationary and non-stationary inputs. All reports must be uniquely sampled.

| Applies to<br/>     | Windows 8 Client x86, x64, ARM (Windows RT)<br/> Windows 8.1 Client x86, x64, ARM (Windows RT 8.1)<br/> |

 

Description

The touch digitizer must have response latency from an active state that is not greater than 25 milliseconds for the initial input. The touch digitizer must have response latency from an idle state that is not greater than 50 milliseconds for the initial input. Both Active and Idle are internal power state of the touch controller. The response latency for subsequent contacts in an active state should not be greater than 15 milliseconds. Response latency will be measured as the time when the input touches the screen to the time when the Windows operating system receives the data from the hardware.

At a minimum, the touch digitizer resolution will be equal the native display resolution or greater. Every pixel of the display in an integrated touch digitizer is required to be accessible to touch input. Every pixel includes pixels on the edges and in the corners of the display.For additional details on verification and testing of this requirement please see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=234575
